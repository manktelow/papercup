00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,680
this

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,800
is a computer

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,200
or at least back in the 1930s 40s and

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,680
50s the person operating it was a

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,520
computer you see back then a fully

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,359
automatic calculator like this one was

7
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:25,119
mind-blowing allowing people to add

8
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,760
subtract multiply and divide large

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,400
numbers without the use of pen and paper

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,920
these days that's all done

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,239
electronically but when richard a local

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,960
fan reached out and said hey i've got

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,079
one of these

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,920
we jumped at the chance to become the

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,480
very thing we love the most

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,879
computers thanks to signalrgb for

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,120
sponsoring this video signalrgb is a

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,200
free application that syncs rgb lighting

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,039
across your entire setup and works for

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,280
brands like corsair razer logitech and

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,800
more check it out at the link down below

[Music]

23
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,920
when i was in school teachers would

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,400
insist we learned to do long division by

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,000
hand because you're not going to be

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
going around carrying a calculator

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,720
everywhere you go well joke's on you

28
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,040
miss parsons cause now everyone is doing

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,159
exactly that and trust me this baby does

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,720
long division but back in the 90s miss

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,479
parsons could be forgiven for thinking

32
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,880
that pocket calculators wouldn't be as

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,119
ubiquitous today seeing as many older

34
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,040
folks back then may have grown up with

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,600
something a lot more like this the

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,479
frieden stw10. if we were to go back

37
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,479
another 30 years there's a good chance

38
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,880
we'd find one of these chunky boys on an

39
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,119
accountant's desk in fact you may have

40
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,040
already seen something like this either

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,079
online or in a stirring historical drama

42
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,640
like hidden figures no it's not a

43
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,320
typewriter although it does sort of

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,159
share some similarities there's a

45
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,640
sliding carriage on top and a large set

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,960
of keys on the body but these are all

47
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,360
numbers and there's no ink or paper

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,920
needed at least not any that you insert

49
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,079
into the machine itself the first set of

50
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,439
mechanical number displays on the

51
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,919
carriage is the accumulator row which

52
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,480
can display results up to 20 digits long

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,400
for reference most pocket calculators

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,959
today only display around 8 or 10 and my

55
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,200
phone can enter up to 15 digits before

56
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,920
it starts using exponents the row below

57
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,720
that is the counter register it serves a

58
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,400
couple of different functions just like

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,840
how our new indoor sweater from

60
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,400
lttstore.com keeps you warm and boosts

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,319
your confidence don't quote me on that

62
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,319
the first function is how it acts as an

63
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,640
item counter when adding or subtracting

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,120
and the second is operations counting

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,519
when multiplying or dividing you can

66
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,840
lock these rows or clear them with some

67
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,239
button presses

68
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,319
or you can use one of these guys down

69
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,640
here to set where the decimal starts for

70
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,040
division i want to start it

71
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,519
there now down here

72
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,840
one numpad would be bush league so we

73
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,159
got two

74
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,159
this little one over here is used only

75
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,400
for entering multiplicands more on that

76
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,280
later and the big one is used for

77
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,920
everything else each digit has its own

78
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,239
column and you enter your total value by

79
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,159
pushing down keys as they would appear

80
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,760
on paper so for example for 1337 we push

81
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,000
them in order like this

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,760
one three three seven if any column has

83
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,560
nothing pressed that counts as zero it's

84
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
a little confusing at first but you get

85
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,319
used to it pretty quickly everything is

86
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,640
housed in a shell made of what we think

87
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,879
is aluminum covered in plastic that's

88
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,879
pretty easy to take off and there's a

89
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,120
giant pad of foam underneath to keep

90
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,200
this mechanical beast from shaking your

91
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,879
table to death

92
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,400
i mean this thing is heavy

93
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,799
oh

94
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,640
i'm doing math

95
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,560
i feel smarter

96
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,319
you can see on the inside it's basically

97
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,519
a giant mishmash of gears levers springs

98
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,720
and arms

99
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,439
it's like mechanical spaghetti in there

100
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,439
it is incredibly complex and the amount

101
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,439
of engineering that went into something

102
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,599
like this is absolutely insane there

103
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,760
were earlier models like the 1941

104
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,840
frieden h8 but these were often limited

105
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,159
to addition and subtraction and weren't

106
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,880
driven electronically the stw10 came out

107
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,720
a few years later and gave simple

108
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,759
computers

109
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,000
like us the ability to multiply and

110
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,199
divide big numbers easily hey

111
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,199
what do you say we crunch some numbers

112
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,840
so to add you enter a value on the main

113
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,600
pad and add it to the top row like this

114
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,000
bam now we enter whatever number we want

115
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,160
to add to that number by entering new

116
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,160
values and pressing the add button again

117
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,080
so what it's actually doing is setting a

118
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,400
value on a number of dials and then

119
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,040
ticking everything up by the new value

120
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,120
in sequence it's a lot like how you

121
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,360
would do paper math adding each digit

122
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,199
until there's an overflow then adding

123
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,040
the overflow to the end if we want to

124
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,600
subtract it's basically doing the exact

125
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,520
opposite by starting with a value and

126
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,680
then decreasing it in sequential order

127
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,440
by the new value

128
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,360
multiplication works in a similar way

129
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,639
it's basically just addition in groups

130
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,880
except this time we get to use the cool

131
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,919
multiplicand numpad i've been waiting so

132
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:16,880
long

133
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,720
this one actually works like what you'd

134
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,240
see in a modern calculator where you

135
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,639
enter each digit serially from left to

136
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,240
right and it brings up your value on

137
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,639
this little display here next we enter

138
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,639
our multiplier on the big numpad

139
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,440
press the mult key

140
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,440
and look at it go

141
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,840
ha

142
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,919
ha that is so cool we'll get some

143
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,919
slow-mo footage but as it's going you

144
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,160
can basically watch it in real time

145
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,919
working through the numbers brute

146
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,160
forcing addition of our multiplicand as

147
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,880
many times as i've told it to because

148
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,880
again i am

149
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,199
the computer division is basically the

150
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,280
same thing but backwards like

151
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,360
subtraction enter your first number on

152
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,060
the big keypad

153
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,720
[Music]

154
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,039
set your decimal place

155
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,160
and hit enter divd

156
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,800
[Music]

157
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,880
this puts the carriage to where it needs

158
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,039
to go according to our decimal point

159
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,560
clear the keyboard if it didn't

160
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,840
automatically

161
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,000
and enter your divisor on the same

162
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,720
keypad

163
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,199
now we're gonna have to hit both

164
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,360
of these divide keys we'll get to why

165
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,680
there are two in a moment but for now

166
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,240
look at it go

167
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,520
oh

168
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,280
man that never gets old just like

169
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,960
hitting that subscribe button never gets

170
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,039
old we've got our eyes on an antique or

171
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,800
a mechanism video in the future that you

172
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,120
don't want to miss now for the most part

173
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,039
this should just work it crunches

174
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,400
through the numbers to the nearest

175
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,560
decimal point and gives us our result

176
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,800
which is uh uh give me a second

177
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,000
33.3

178
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,560
repeating of course but if you were to

179
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,440
accidentally divide a number by zero the

180
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,919
machine can get stuck in an infinite

181
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,160
loop

182
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,000
what

183
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,919
back in the 40s and 50s if a room of

184
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,440
accountants or something was using

185
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,240
automatic calculators without this handy

186
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,479
div stop function we have right here

187
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,280
there'd actually be a guy in the room

188
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,440
whose job it was to basically just

189
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,759
listen for this infinite loop and walk

190
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,199
around resetting machines

191
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,840
now this bad boy is pretty well lubed

192
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,960
thanks to richard did you lube it up

193
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,919
oh yeah but rapidly moving metal moving

194
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,880
for a long time gets really hot so if

195
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,160
there was no button or no button man

196
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,680
you'd find out what was at the end of

197
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,520
that infinite loop molten destruction

198
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,680
at this moment you're probably screaming

199
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,319
at me at the top of your lungs riley why

200
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,879
does this have two division buttons why

201
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,720
i'm gonna need you to calm down by the

202
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,560
time division and multiplication were

203
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,800
added someone else had already beaten

204
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,960
frieden to the punch and patented a

205
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,039
single button division system preventing

206
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,280
freedom from including it in this model

207
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,360
if you press only the left division

208
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
button the division will take place but

209
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,599
you'll get only the tens complement of

210
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,879
the expected result now the stw10 was

211
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,599
only designed to do addition subtraction

212
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,240
multiplication and division but some

213
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,639
masters of the universe actually figured

214
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,800
out how to get square roots on this

215
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,200
thing how you ask

216
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,640
wizardry

217
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,399
uh

218
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,719
dining so in order to actually do a

219
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,440
square root on a calculator like this

220
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,360
you have to follow a number of different

221
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,680
types of algorithms to actually do it

222
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,080
these machines don't have a push square

223
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,320
root button but math has developed

224
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,959
algorithms that you can use to quickly

225
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,600
calculate a square root on a machine

226
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,920
like this or on paper or anywhere else

227
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,200
for this machine the algorithm that

228
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,120
we're looking at using is the sum of odd

229
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,680
squares for our sake it works i'll take

230
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,200
you through the steps of how it works

231
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,160
for

232
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,040
this 69 420. first up you move your

233
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,080
carriage

234
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,360
all the way over

235
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,760
and make sure that it's aligned with the

236
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
tenth digit of your number then you

237
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,800
enter

238
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,440
plus five times

239
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,560
now clear off and move the carriage

240
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,240
all the way over now we'll go through

241
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,360
and actually get into the weeds of

242
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,600
calculating this number out you put a

243
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,720
five

244
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,800
in the next column over this is the

245
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
column we're actually calculating one

246
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,360
and you start subtracting away

247
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,600
as we're going through each increment

248
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,200
we're essentially adding another one of

249
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,839
the odd numbers through some math magic

250
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,560
but as we're subtracting away subtract

251
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,519
one

252
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,720
subtract

253
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,560
two that's when you know that's the

254
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,160
number you're looking for you add it

255
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,600
back

256
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,040
shift the carriage

257
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,680
over one shift the five over one

258
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,440
and start again and this is where it

259
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,279
starts getting

260
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,839
a little bit repetitive

261
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,160
but it works

262
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,880
there's another underflow

263
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,240
add it back

264
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,200
clear the five move it over

265
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,560
shift the carriage

266
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,440
and again

267
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,360
underflow

268
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,560
add it back

269
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,959
clear the five move it over

270
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,240
shift the carriage

271
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,640
and subtract

272
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,120
underflow

273
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,240
back

274
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,600
and repeat

275
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,519
in this particular algorithm we're

276
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,600
breaking it up by individual digit

277
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,440
similar to like what you do on paper so

278
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,120
we're starting with the biggest number

279
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,040
and slowly shifting our way down as we

280
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,200
move on and that's an easier way to try

281
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,680
to handle numbers that are five plus

282
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,279
digits long especially for a square root

283
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,279
and

284
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,959
now that we're on this last line we

285
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,640
can't move the five over anymore but we

286
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,880
just cleared off shift over the carriage

287
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,560
and do the same step again just without

288
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,279
the extra five

289
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,160
and now we've done the square root but

290
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,240
where's the answer we have a whole bunch

291
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,680
of different numbers on the board for

292
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,079
this it's actually the board itself we

293
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,519
have two

294
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,320
six

295
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,440
three

296
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,480
point

297
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,079
four seven

298
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:20,959
six

299
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,839
seven

300
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:22,800
five

301
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,600
four

302
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,399
one

303
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,240
so this kind of shows the power of you

304
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,839
know interesting approaches to trying to

305
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,760
solve calculations that used to take

306
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,920
minutes hours days in an order of

307
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,839
magnitude less time how long would that

308
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,160
take you to do on fan paper

309
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,680
i'd have to learn how to do it on pen

310
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,320
and paper first

311
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,240
so what happened to calculators like

312
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,560
this well frieden sold thousands of

313
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,399
these things primarily to accounting and

314
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,320
insurance companies and then ended

315
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,279
production of the stw10 in 1966 as the

316
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,440
ec130 a transistor calculator with a 13

317
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,000
digit capacity started taking over

318
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
frieden was bought out by singer known

319
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,680
primarily for their sewing machines at

320
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,680
the time and eventually died off in the

321
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,399
70s as pocket calculators like this one

322
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,360
hit the market i mean as awesome as this

323
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,639
absolute unit is it's pretty obvious why

324
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,720
these started winning out twelve

325
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,920
thousand eight hundred and seventy two

326
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,200
multiplied by four thousand three

327
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,560
hundred and seven and go

328
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,320
yeah uh sorry frieden uh

329
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,600
still love ya

330
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,279
if you want to try and buy one of these

331
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,959
and try and restore it yourself they

332
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,040
seem to go from anywhere between two and

333
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,160
five hundred dollars if you can find one

334
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,240
you'll also be lucky if yours arrives in

335
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,560
perfectly working condition if you want

336
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,639
